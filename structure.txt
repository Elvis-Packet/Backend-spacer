### Spacer Platform Project Documentation

1. Backend Implementation (Flask & SQLAlchemy)

Framework & Tools:

        Flask for backend API development

        SQLAlchemy as ORM for database operations

        PostgreSQL for relational database

        Flask-Migrate for database migrations

Database Schema:

        Models (4 Minimum):

        User: Stores user credentials, roles (admin/client/owner).

        Space: Contains space details (title, price, owner).

        Booking: Manages reservations (user_id, space_id, timing).

       #####Feature: Lists amenities (WiFi, projectors) with a many-to-many relationship to Space.

Relationships:

1. Many-to-Many: Space ↔ Feature

        A space (e.g., "Co-Working Lounge") can have multiple features (amenities like WiFi, Projector, Catering).

        A feature can belong to multiple spaces.

        Implementation:

        Columns: space_id (Foreign Key → Space), feature_id (Foreign Key → Feature).

        In Models:

        Space.features: Relationship to Feature via secondary=space_features.

        Feature.spaces: Back-reference to all spaces with that feature.

        Example:

        Space A (Conference Room) ↔ Features: [Projector, WiFi]

        Space B (Café) ↔ Features: [WiFi, Catering]

2. One-to-Many: User → Space

        A user (with role "owner") can list multiple spaces.

        Each space belongs to one owner.

        Implementation:

        Foreign Key: Space.owner_id references User.id.

        Relationship:

        User.spaces: All spaces owned by a user (backref from Space).

        Example:

        User X (Owner) → [Space A, Space B]

3. One-to-Many: User → Booking

        A user (client) can make multiple bookings.

        Each booking is tied to one user.

    Implementation:

        Foreign Key: Booking.user_id references User.id.

        Relationship:

        User.bookings: All reservations made by a user.

        Example:

        User Y (Client) → [Booking 1 (Space A), Booking 2 (Space C)]

4. One-to-Many: Space → Booking
        A space can have multiple bookings (time slots).

        Each booking references one space.

    Implementation:

        Foreign Key: Booking.space_id references Space.id.

        Relationship:

        Space.bookings: All reservations for that space.

        Example:

        Space A → [Booking 1 (User Y), Booking 2 (User Z)]



2. Frontend Implementation (React & Redux)
Core Technologies:

        React for UI components

        Redux Toolkit for state management

        React Router for client-side routing (5+ routes)

        Axios for API calls

Client-Side Routes:

        Home (/): List featured spaces.

        Spaces (/spaces): Browse all spaces with filters.

        Space Details (/spaces/:id): View details + booking form.

        Bookings (/bookings): User’s reservation history.

        Admin (/admin): Dashboard for space/user management.



3. CRUD Operations (RESTful Conventions)
        Full CRUD on Space Model:

        Create: POST /api/spaces (Admin/Owner).

        Read: GET /api/spaces (Public) & GET /api/spaces/:id (Detailed view).

        Update: PUT /api/spaces/:id (Owner/Admin).

        Delete: DELETE /api/spaces/:id (Admin).

4. Validation & Error Handling
Backend Validations:

        Space: Title length, positive pricing.

        Booking: Valid timings, non-conflicting slots.

        User: Email format, password strength.

        Error Responses:

        Standardized JSON errors (400, 401, 404, 500).

        Frontend displays user-friendly messages.

5. New Feature (Beyond Curriculum)
        Simulated Payment Processing:

        Mock payment flow with Stripe-like UI.

        PDF invoice generation for bookings.

        "Agreement Incubator" for digital contracts.

6. State Management (Redux)
Slices:

        authSlice: Manages login state/JWT tokens.

        spaceSlice: Handles space data/filters.

        bookingSlice: Tracks reservations/payment status.

7. Project Setup
Backend:

        Install dependencies: Flask, SQLAlchemy, psycopg2.

        Configure PostgreSQL database URL in .env.

        Run migrations: flask db init && flask db migrate && flask db upgrade.

Frontend:

        Install: react-router-dom, @reduxjs/toolkit, axios.

Start dev server: npm start.

8. Testing & Validation
        Backend: Pytest for API endpoints/model validations.

        Frontend: Jest + React Testing Library for components.
