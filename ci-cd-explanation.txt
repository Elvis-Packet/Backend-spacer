The CI/CD pipeline we implemented automates the process of checking, testing, and deploying our backend code to ensure quality and efficiency. Here's an explanation you can share with your group members:

What is CI/CD?
CI (Continuous Integration) is the practice of automatically integrating code changes from multiple contributors into a shared repository several times a day. It involves automatically building and testing the code to catch issues early.
CD (Continuous Deployment/Delivery) automates the release of validated code to production or staging environments, ensuring that new features and fixes reach users quickly and reliably.
How Our CI/CD Pipeline Works
Our CI/CD pipeline is defined in the .github/workflows/ci-cd.yml file. This file tells GitHub Actions what to do when code is pushed or a pull request is made to the main branch.

The pipeline has three main jobs:

1. Linting

Checks the code style and quality using flake8.
Ensures our Python code follows best practices and is free of common errors.
Testing

Sets up a PostgreSQL database service for testing.
Installs dependencies and runs database migrations.
Runs automated tests using pytest with coverage reporting.
Uploads coverage reports to Codecov for visibility.


2 .Deployment

After linting and testing pass, the code is deployed to Render (our hosting platform).
Uses the Render CLI to deploy the backend service securely using API keys stored as GitHub secrets.
Key Features in the .yml File
Triggers: The workflow runs on every push or pull request to the main branch.
Caching: Python package dependencies are cached to speed up workflow runs.
Virtual Environment: A Python virtual environment is created to isolate dependencies.
Database Service: A PostgreSQL service runs during tests to simulate the production environment.
Test Coverage: Tests generate coverage reports to ensure code quality.
Secure Deployment: Deployment credentials are stored securely as GitHub secrets and used during deployment.
This automation helps us maintain high code quality, catch bugs early, and deploy updates quickly without manual intervention.
